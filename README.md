# NotiCast Hardware
Documentation over the NotiCast hardware devices

**Note:** The hardware listed is not required to build a NotiCast device. All
that is needed is a typical Raspberry Pi setup, the SD card with NotiCast
compatible software, and the flash drive containing the credentials for the
device. These are just for building the custom speakers.

## Shopping List

- Ethernet crimp tool
- Ethernet coupler
- Potentiometer for volume control (usb? don't know how to analog to Pi)
- USB "extender" for flash drive
- 5v "extender" for power supply
